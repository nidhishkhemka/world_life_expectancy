# World Life Expectancy - Data Cleaning Project

## Case Study
The purpose of this project is to clean and preprocess a dataset to ensure the data is ready for analysis. This project involves identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for further analysis.

## Description
This project comprises a series of SQL scripts designed to clean and preprocess the data from a raw dataset. By executing these scripts, you will be able to prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis, ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize SQL for data cleaning to address issues in the raw dataset and make it analysis-ready. The cleaning process aims to:

- Identify and remove duplicates.
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Correct data inconsistencies and errors.
- Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
